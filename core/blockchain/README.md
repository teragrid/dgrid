# `Blockchain Services`

 provide fundamental blockchain and storage services for Teragrid Network. These services consist of Membership Manager, Distributed LeagueChain, which are built on top of P2P Protocols and LeagueChain Storages.

# Membership Manager
  is responsible for managing membership of a cell to a certain league. Once a cell join or leave a league, the participation or membership information will be updated and managed by Membership Manager module.

# Distributed LeagueChain
  is an independent blockchain for each league, the chain will be kept locally on each physical node of Teragrid Network.

# P2P Protocols
  is in charge of providing a means for peer-to-peer communication among nodes or cells in the Teragrid Network.

# LeagueChain Storages:
  is considered as a distributed low-level database which stores and manages all blockchains created and used in created leagues of the Teragrid Network. LeagueChain Storages will be synchronized across the network to ensure integrity of data stored in blockchains.
