# `D-Code Services`

offer services related to d-codes or smart contracts. These services contain Secure Sandbox which is built on top of Secure Register.

# Secure Sandbox
  is d-codes run-time environment and it is designed for better security. D-codes run in Teragrid are considered as infinite-loop programs. Therefore, being executed in a secure sandbox will guarantee that any crushes or tampered actions will be minimized and thus, that will not impact the other modules or components of the system.

# Secure Register
  plays as role as a secure database to store execution-related data for d-codes besides blockchains. Last but not least, services in the Parkhill Core will be communicated with each other via events and messages. In order to ensure the processing order and overall performance improvement, message queues or message brokers will be used in the Teragrid system.
